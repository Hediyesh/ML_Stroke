# Classification on Stroke Dataset Using Machine Learning

## About the Files
The `main.py` file contains all the project code in Python. The `Image` folder contains output images from the code, like bar charts. The `.xlsx` files contain data, and their use is indicated by their names.

## Methods of the Code
This project is a machine learning project on the Stroke dataset.  
- First, functions help us understand the data better.  
- Next, we handle outliers and missing values and then normalize the data.  
- There are five different decision trees, and their output includes visualizations of the trees, rules, and the total number of rules.

In the future, other ML algorithms will be added. 

## About the Dataset
The stroke dataset consists of 5110 records of patients with various attributes. The target feature is `stroke`, and other features include `age`, `gender`, `work_type`, and more. This dataset is widely used in classification tasks, and many papers have used it to build classifiers.
