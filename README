<strong> Classification on Stroke dataset using Machine Learning </strong>

This project is a machine learning project on Stroke dataset. 
First we have functions that help us understand the data better. Then we handle outlier and missing values and then we normalize data. 
There are 5 different decision trees and as their output we can see the trees, rules and total number of rules.
In future, other ML algorithms will be added.
